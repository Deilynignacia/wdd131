            <h2>
                Why do we celebrate Christmas?
            </h2>

            <p>
                More than just a tradition or a holiday, Christmas is an outpouring of joy that comes from celebrating 
                the birth of Jesus Christ. Christ's birth is evidence that our Heavenly Father loves His children so much 
                that He sent His Son to show us the way to true happiness.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bible prophets like Isaiah and Micah foretold the birth of Jesus Christ. The prophetess Anna shared of 
                His coming. And many other prophets in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, such as 
                Nephi, Alma, and Samuel prepared for the Messiah.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Hebrew, Bethlehem means “house of bread.” President Russell M. Nelson said, “How appropriate that He, 
                the "bread of life" [John 6:35, 48] would come from the "house of bread"” (“Divine Gifts” [First 
                Presidency Christmas devotional, Dec. 6, 2020]). Mary “brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped 
                him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn” 
                (Luke 2:7).
            </p>

            <p>
                Shepherds were the first to hear of the birth of Jesus Christ. An angel appeared, announcing, “For unto 
                you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:11). Wise men saw 
                a star in the east and came to worship Jesus after His birth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of the birth of Jesus Christ, we can experience peace, hope, and joy in our lives today. Learn 
                more about how Jesus Christ can help you live a happier life.
